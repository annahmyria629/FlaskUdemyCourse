What happens, when user enters google in browser?
1) Browser sends URL to ISP(Internet Service Provider)
2) ISP does DNS lookup - makes search in table, which contains hostname and ip (both are unique)
3) ISP finds ip address of URL and sends it back to the browser
4) Browser takes this ip (maybe, caches it for later), after that sends get http request on ip
5) Web server receives request and sends response(html, json, xml

Difference between web service and web application:
- Web service api returns JSON
- Web app api returns html

All communication between server/server, server/browser, browser/browser can only be done with text
because of TCP protocol supports only text as messages format

JSON
{
    "string field": "string field",
    "number field": 1,
    "bool field": 1, - not all browser supports
    "null field": null, - not all browser supports
    "array field": [1, "abc", {"f1": "its object", "this is nested array": []}],

}
